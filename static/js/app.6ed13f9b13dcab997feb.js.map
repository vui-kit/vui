It provides a flexible class that encourages proper grouping \n\t\t\tof labels, controls, optional help text, and form validation messaging. By default \n\t\t\tit only applies margin-bottom, but it picks up additional styles in <code>inline</code> \n\t\t\tprop as needed.

They communicate information \n\t\t\tvia a secondary window and allow the user to maintain the context of a particular task.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThere are a wide range of use cases from user notification to custom content and they feature \n\t\t\tan array of helpful sub-components, sizes, colors and more.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBy default the modal is vertically centered, this can be changed by setting various props.\n\t\t\tAlso by default the modal has <code>Cancel</code> and <code>Ok</code> buttons in the footer.\n\t\t\tThe footer and header can be customized through the use of templates. Default button actions\n\t\t\temit events that you can use to hide/show and apply custom actions. Clicking on the modal \"backdrop\"\n\t\t\twill not automatically close the modal.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe default modal title can be changed by setting the <code>title</code> and <code>icon</code>\n\t\t\tprops. When using the custom templates for header and footer, the default elements will not \n\t\t\tbe displayed.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tModals use <code>position: fixed</code>, which can sometimes be a bit particular about its rendering. \n\t\t\tWhenever possible, place your modal HTML in a top-level position to avoid potential interference \n\t\t\tfrom other elements. You’ll likely run into issues when nesting a modal within another fixed element.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tModals use percentages for their vertical positioning and sizing. Using pixel values will not work.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<br><br>\n\n\t\t<h3 id=\"example\">Example</h3>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBelow is a static modal example (meaning its position and display have been overridden). \n\t\t\tIncluded are the modal header, modal body (required for padding), and modal footer (optional). \n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<vui-code-panel>\n\t\t\t<template slot=\"example\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"card shadow rounded w-75\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"card-header\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-sm-6\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 class=\"modal-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"icon-warning-sign mr-1\"></i> Modal Title\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h5>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-sm-6\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"icon-remove float-right modal-close\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"card-body card-text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tModal body text goes here.\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"card-footer text-muted text-right\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<vui-button color=\"secondary\">Cancel</vui-button>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<vui-button color=\"primary\">Ok</vui-button>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</template>\n\t\t\t<template slot=\"code\">{{ example1 }}</template>\n\t\t</vui-code-panel>\n\n\t\t<br><br>\n\n\t\t<h3 id=\"events\">Default Events</h3>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBy default the modal will emit two events: <code>close</code> and <code>ok</code>.
